          <h1>Basic Food Groups</h1>  
          <img id="balanced2" src="imgg/nutrition-pyramid_23-2148488917.jpg" alt="">
          <p>For adequate and balanced nutrition, the foods in the following 5 basic food groups should be consumed in the recommended amount.</p>
          <h3>Milk Group</h3>
          <p>All age groups, especially adult women, children and young people, should consume this group every day.</p>
          <p class="goal">Foods in this group:</p>
          <p>Milk and its substitutes; dairy foods such as yoghurt, cheese, and milk powder</p>
          <p class="goal">Important Nutrients Contained:</p>
          <p>It is an important source of many nutrients such as protein, calcium, phosphorus, vitamin B2 (riboflavin) and vitamin B12.</p>
          
          <p class="goal">Main Duties:</p>
          <p>
This group, which is rich in calcium, plays an important role in the healthy development of bones and teeth and cell work.</p>
       <p>Adults should consume 2 servings per day, children, adolescents, pregnant and lactating women and postmenopausal women should consume 3-4 servings of milk and substitutes. One serving is a medium cup (200 cc) of milk or yogurt and two matchbox-sized cheese.</p>
        <p>Choose skimmed or reduced-fat milk, yoghurt and low-salt cheese. Raw milk and cheese made from unpasteurized milk and similar foods cause brucellosis in humans. For this reason, do not consume milk sold on the street of unknown origin. Choose pasteurized or UHT (long-life milk) milk. Do not buy street milk sold by people whose source you do not know and do not know. Low-boiling milk does not kill all of the germs in the milk. Boiling milk too much causes vitamin loss. At least 5 minutes after the milk reaches the boiling point. Boiling can be beneficial in terms of hygiene. Straining of yogurt water or discharging the water that occurs during holding causes vitamin B2 (riboflavin) loss. Riboflavin is a vitamin that has important functions in the body. For this reason, the greenish water of yogurt should not be thrown away and should be evaluated. It should be used in fermentation of bread, making biscuits and cakes and soups. The plastic yoghurt containers purchased should not be used for food storage afterwards. Sugar should be added when the milk dessert is taken from the stove after cooking. When the sugar added during cooking and the protein of the milk combine, protein loss occurs. Tarhana is a traditional food made without yoghurt, flour or splitting. It has an important place in our diet. However, the drying process should be done in a shady place with air flow, covered with a thin clean cloth and should not be dried under the sun. Otherwise, important vitamin losses occur. Eating yoghurt and drinking salted buttermilk in the treatment of diarrhea saves lives.</p>
         
         <h3>Meat-Egg-Legumes Group</h3>
         <p class="goal">Foods in this group:</p>

<br>●It is the most important food group that has a role in gaining resistance against diseases.</p>
         <h3>Meats</h3>

<br>● It should be purchased from trusted places; If it will not be consumed immediately, it should be stored in a cold or freezer.</p>
        <h3>Egg</h3>
        <p><br>● Since its protein quality is high, it is beneficial to consume one period every day by babies and children.
<br>● Egg is an important source of protein due to its sample protein content in diseases such as kidney and liver failure, where the amount of protein in the diet is restricted.
<br>● Since microorganisms can easily pass to the egg from the shells, the white should be cooked and consumed well.
 <br>● Uncooked (raw) eggs should not be Cardiovascular patients can eat eggs 1-2 times a week.
<br>● Those who do not eat meat can eat eggs as a meat option. An egg is equivalent to egg-sized meat in terms of nutritional value.

<br>● Lecithin in egg helps regular brain functions.
<br>● When purchasing, clean, cracked and unbroken eggs should be selected and stored in the refrigerator without washing.

Although the quality of this protein is low, protein quality can be increased when consumed together with legumes or foods such as meat, milk and eggs. Cereals also contain some oil. The oil of cereal grains is rich in vitamin E. There is almost no vitamin C in cereals, with elements that show vitamin A activity. Grains are rich in B group vitamins other than B12, especially the best source of vitamin B1 (thiamine). These vitamins are mostly found in the shell and core of cereal grains and are rich in minerals and vitamins.
