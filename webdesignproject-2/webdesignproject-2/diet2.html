          <p class="goal">Adequate and Balanced Nutrition is the Foundation of Health.</p>
          <p>Nutrition is not suppressing the feeling of hunger, filling the stomach, or eating whatever you crave.</p>
          
          <p>Nutrition; It is a conscious behavior in order to take the nutrients that the body needs in sufficient amounts and at appropriate times in order to protect and improve health and to increase the quality of life.</p>
          <p class="goal">Inadequate Nutrition occurs when nutrients cannot be taken at the level of the body's needs.</p>
          
          <p>A person needs nearly 50 nutrients for his life. It has been determined how much of each of these elements should be taken daily for a healthy growth and development, and a healthy and productive life for a long time.</p>
          
          <p>When any of these items are not taken, when taken more or less than necessary, growth and development are inhibited, health is impaired. This condition is called Unbalanced Nutrition.</p>
